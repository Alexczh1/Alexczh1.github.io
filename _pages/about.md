I am Ziheng Cheng, a senior-year undergraduate student in School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. My research interests span broadly in statistics, optimization and machine learning. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me. Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).
